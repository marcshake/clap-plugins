## Several Linux Plugins in Clap-Format

## Information

I haven't coded in C since 25 years but I want to refresh my knowlegde again. As I am a _Linuxmusician_ I have the same problem, any linux-daw-person has: There is a specific plugin available for windows and I want to have something similar in Linux. Like I already said: I am just "restarting" my _C-Journey_ so development will be very slow at the beginning.

## Plugins

This is the list of effects I want to make:

* Simple ping pong delay
* Simple Analog-Filter
* Reverbaration

This is a list of instruments I want to make

* MonoSynth
* A rompler
* A sfz/sf2-player
* A Sample-Lib-Player

## Disclaimer

This has started as a solo-show. But if we, as musicians in Linux, want to have cool stuff, we have to do it ourselves.
